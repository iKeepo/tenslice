# How to concentrate

Like the CPU's working pattern, cut the running time into slices.
Cut the brain's power into 10 minutes, do one task every 10 minutes, then transfer to another one.

## What's the benefit for doing this?

1. shorten transfer
Normally, we could rethink the harvest of whole day's work at the night. In this way, we get something or 检讨 something one day one time.
If we use tenslice method, we can review every 10 minutes which raise the turnover of value getting.

Every day get new knowledge is the only way to sucess, don'e be the person replaying everyday for many times. If you didn't get something new, you just repeat an old day again which is called waste.

2. do the thing you want
It's a common phenomenon that we are too busy to do something besides daily work, which means the routine business occupy all our time, so that we can't do what we want, and have to pass it to tomorrow and tomorrow again.
But in the tenslice mode, we can do what we want to do in the next 10 minutes, because we have enough slice to do anything we want.
And acctually, the thing we want to do is usually don't behavior at our first glip, so the earlier we begin, the better we get feedback.

3. focus on problem, rather knowledge
Knowledge is power is the most misleading concept in current era.
Don't care about knowledge, just focus your problem.
Don't think about knowledge, think about problem.

4. education vs training
Just like point 3, problem is better than knowledge, training is much useful than education.
Training is about how to do thing, how to solve problem, education is about knowledge, about what is it.
